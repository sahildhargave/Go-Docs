- **MongoDB Integration:** Learn how to connect to a MongoDB database from a Go application.
- **Create Operation:** Add new documents to a MongoDB collection.
- **Read Operation:** Fetch documents from the collection.
- **Update Operation:** Modify existing documents in the collection.
- **Delete Operation:** Remove documents from the collection.


- **MongoDB:** Install and run MongoDB on your local machine or use a remote MongoDB instance.

- **Mongo Go Driver:** Install the MongoDB Go driver by running:

- **Goroutines:** Explore the use of goroutines, lightweight threads that enable concurrent execution of tasks. Goroutines enhance the efficiency of your program by allowing concurrent operations without the overhead of traditional threads.
  

- **Parallelism:** Witness the benefits of parallelism as multiple goroutines work concurrently to perform a task. The `sync.WaitGroup` ensures synchronization, making the main program wait for all goroutines to complete.
  
# Mutex in Go Lang

A mutex, short for "mutual exclusion," is a synchronization mechanism used in Go programming to protect shared resources from concurrent access by multiple goroutines. In a concurrent program, where multiple goroutines are executing simultaneously, accessing shared data without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of a mutex is to ensure that only one goroutine can access a critical section of code or shared data at a time. It provides a way to serialize access, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

## How it Works

1. **Locking:** When a goroutine wants to access a shared resource, it must first acquire the mutex lock using the `Lock` method. If the lock is already held by another goroutine, the requesting goroutine will be blocked until the lock becomes available.

    ```go
    var mu sync.Mutex

    // Lock the mutex before accessing shared data
    mu.Lock()
    // ... access shared data ...
    mu.Unlock() // Unlock when done
    ```

2. **Unlocking:** Once the goroutine has finished its work with the shared resource, it must release the mutex lock using the `Unlock` method. This allows other waiting goroutines to acquire the lock and access the shared resource.

    ```go
    var mu sync.Mutex

    // Lock the mutex before accessing shared data
    mu.Lock()
    // ... access shared data ...
    mu.Unlock() // Unlock when done
    ```

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter int
var mu sync.Mutex

func increment() {
	mu.Lock()
	counter++
	mu.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			increment()
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}

# Race Condition in golang
 -- there multiple threads going on memory space is runing thread and onther thread will operate on same memory space then Race condition work in golang

 # Race Condition 
 ```bin 
 Run commond 
 go work use.

then:
go run --race .


## channel 

--- can not pass data if any one is not listening
go listen listen_channel <- "hello"
